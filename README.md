## **Introduction**
This project is my attempt at Task 1 of the Python Developer internship at LetsGrowMore. The goal is to create a tool which creates GIF images from videos, using Python. The approach taken for this task is creating a GUI application which fulfills all of the desired functions (e.g. adding files, setting parameters and saving files).

## **Details**
* **<u>Project Title:</u>** *Create a GIF Creator using Python*
* **<u>Project Description:</u>** As famous as the gif market has become over these years now, demand for quality gifs is going up. The majority of people use these to communicate with others on social media platforms like WhatsApp, Instagram, etc. We will build a GIF Creator that creates GIFs from images here. In this project, you will be using the `moviepy` Python module for development purposes.
* **<u>Project Submission:</u>** All of the work to be evaluated for this project is found in the `main` folder in the current directory. An explanatory example can also be found in the `notebook` folder in the current directory, in order to aid the reader in better understanding how the contents of the `main` folder work.
* **<u>Libraries Used:</u>** The following libraries were used for the stated purposes:
  - `os`, for handling redundant files;
  - `tkinter`, for creating an interactive GUI application carrying out all of the necessary functions, and;
  - `moviepy`, for extracting GIF images from videos.
