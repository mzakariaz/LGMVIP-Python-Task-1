## **Introduction**
This project is my attempt at Task 1 of the Python Developer internship at LetsGrowMore. The goal is to create a tool which creates GIF images from videos, as well as from static images. This is accomplished using the `moviepy` library. The `os` library is also used as an auxiliary library to delete any redundant files which are created.
